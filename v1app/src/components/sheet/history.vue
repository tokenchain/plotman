      <p> In the 1970s, Gianni Versace was an up-and-coming fashion designer living in and working out of Milan. By
      1972, he had designed his first collection for Callaghan, Genny, and Complice. This collection received high
      praise in the fashion world, but Gianni still had dreams about starting his own fashion brand.
      </p>
      <p> In 1978, Gianni Versace made that dream a reality by opening the very first Versace boutique in Milan’s Via
      Della Spiga. At the time that he opened this boutique, Gianni was one of the only designers in the industry to
      control every aspect of his brand. This level of control allowed Gianni to guide Versace per his exact vision,
      from how his clothing was designed to how it was displayed and marketed and beyond.
      </p>
      <p> For the first four years, Versace sold only designer clothing. In 1982, however, the company began to expand
      by offering other products such as designer accessories, furniture, and fine China under the Versace brand.
      </p>
      <p> Nevertheless, it was the clothing and apparel that Versace would become famous for. While Gianni’s eye for
      design no doubt played a major role in Versace’s success, there was another factor that helped establish Versace
      as one of the premier fashion brands in the world – Gianni’s connections to the music industry and his
      innovative approach to marketing.
      </p>
      <p> Gianni Versace was close friends with a number of high-profile stars in the music industry, including Elton
      John, Eric Clapton, Naomi Campbell, Cher, Madonna, the members of Duran Duran, and many others. When these
      celebrity friends of Gianni began showing up for photoshoots and awards ceremonies wearing the Versace brand,
      people took notice. Gianni Versace became one of the first designers to link the music industry to the fashion
      industry, and it was a match that brought rich rewards to the Versace brand. Suddenly, everyone was wanting to
      wear the same dress that Cher had on or the same belt that Elton John was wearing – and that meant a flood of
      new customers for Versace.
      </p>
      <p> In 1997, though, tragedy struck. On July 15, 1997, 50 year old Gianni Versace was returning to his Miami Beach
      mansion when he was shot and killed by Andrew Cunnan. Cunnan was obsessed with Gianni Versace and was known for
      often bragging about his close relationship with the designer. However, there’s disagreement on whether Gianni
      and Andrew Cunnan had even met before prior to the murder, and most are quite certain that the two men did not
      have a close relationship. Either way, though, Andrew Cunnan robbed the world of one its most talented designers
      before taking his own life with the same gun eight days later.
      </p>
      <p> Following Gianni Versace’s tragic death, the brand was taken over by his siblings, Donatella and Santo
      Versace. Santo became the CEO of the company while Donatella took over the role of the creative director.
      </p>
      <p> By the early 2000s, though, the company’s profits had hit a decline. A couple of different CEOs were brought
      in to try and right the ship, but both soon left, citing disagreement with the Versace family as their reason
      for abandoning their role as CEO.
      </p>
      <p> Nevertheless, Versace still remains one of the most recognizable and sought-after brands in the world today.
      Even since their early 2000 struggles, the company has been involved in a wide range of ventures, including
      building a luxury hotel, working with Lamborghini to produce a Versace branded Lamborghini car, working with
      AgustaWestland to produce a Versace branded helicopter, and of course continuing to produce clothing and apparel
      that is worn by the rich and famous all over the world.
      </p>
      <p> Of course, anytime you look at a Versace product, from the Versace helicopter to any of their pieces of
      clothing, there’s one thing that you are bound to notice – the Medusa head, which serves as the brand’s
      distinctive logo. The question is, how does Medusa go from being one of the most frightening creatures in Greek
      mythology to the symbol of one of the most luxurious fashion brands in the world?
